## 👨‍💻 About Me:
> I had some experience with Java, Python and C programming languages. And after this, I know that Frontend development is the most interesting for me. My goal is become a real professional developer.
I don't have work experience, but I participated in a Hackathon and we were doing a CRM employee scheduling system. We only took 10th place, but it was my first experience and I enjoyed it very much. And also I'm studying at 21 School by Sber. This school was made from French School 42.
My strengths are communication skills, responsibility, a great desire to develop professionally and I am always happy to help others to achieve their goals and gain new knowledge. I really appreciate the Peer to Peer system
